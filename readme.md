## About The Project
This web application simplifies searching and watching YouTube videos. It was built using React and React Router for the front end and leverages the YouTube Data API to fetch relevant video search results and details. Users can easily search for videos using relevant keywords, and the results will display the video's title, channel name, description, and thumbnail image. When they click on a video, they'll be directed to a separate page where they can enjoy watching the video and find more information about it. This application was developed with a focus on providing a smooth user experience on all types of devices and screen sizes. The application is responsive and adaptable, ensuring that users have a seamless experience regardless of the device they use to access it. To enhance the overall user interface and make it more engaging, the application includes some simple yet effective animations. The application was styled using Tailwind CSS, which allows for easy and efficient customization of styles.



## Key features of this project include:


1. Video Search: The application allows users to search for videos using keywords and displays the search results in an easy-to-read format.

2. Video Playback: Users can watch videos directly from the application by clicking on a video in the search results. The application provides a separate page for video playback and displays additional video details such as title, channel name, and description.

3. Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a seamless user experience.

4. Integration with YouTube API: The application uses the YouTube Data API to fetch search results and video details, ensuring the most up-to-date and accurate data is displayed to users.

5. Styling with Tailwind CSS: The application uses the Tailwind CSS framework for styling, providing a modern and clean design that is also customizable and easy to maintain.
